# Python - if/else, loops, functions

* Tasks meant to practice if/else conditionals, loops and functions in Python

### Positive anything is better than negative nothing

* A program that assigns a random number to the variable `number` each time it is executed.
* The program prints whether random number is zero, negative, or positive

### The Last Digit

* The program Assigns a randon number to the variable `number` each time it executes
* It then prints `number's` last digit whilst checking whether it is less than 6 and not 0

### I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

* The program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line

### When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

* The program prints the ASCII alphabet (except 'q' and 'e'), in lowercase, not followed by a new line

### Hexadecimal printing

* The program prints all numbers from 0 - 98 in decimal and hexadecimal

### 00...99

* The program prints numbers 0 - 99 separated by `,` followed by space.
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order followed by a new line

### Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use,the less material you use

* The program prints all possible different combinations of two digits
* 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of digits 0 and 1

### islower

* The function checks for lowercase characters

### To uppercase

* The function prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line

### There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

* The function prints and returns the last digit of a number

### a + b

* The function add two integers and returns the result

### a ^ b

* The function computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value

### Fizz Buzz

* The function prints the numbers from 1 - 100 separated by a space
* For multiples of three, it prints Fizz
* For multiples of five, it prints Buzz
* For multiples of both three and five, it prints FizzBuzz
