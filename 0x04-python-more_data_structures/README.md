## Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
* The tasks herein cover practice on the concept of Set and Dictionary data structures.
* The project is also a build-up on the concepts learned in 0x03-python-data_structures
### Squared simple
* Function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix
### Search and replace
* Function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list
### Unique addition
* Function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer)
### Present in both
* Function that returns a set of common elements in two sets
### Only differents
* Function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set
### Number of keys
* Function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary
### Print sorted dictionary
* Function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys
### Update dictionary
* Function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary
### Simple delete by key
* Function that deletes a key in a dictionary
### Multiply by 2
* Function that returns a new dictionary
### Best score
* Function that returns a key with the biggest integer value
### Multiply by using map
* Function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops
